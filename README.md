## Why I selected this data set for this project
For this assignment I chose to do Disney movies because during the summer I watched a lot of Disney movies. Also, I thought that doing this data set would give me a lot of options and opportunities which it did. I was able to have a lot of functionality with this data. The possibilities with this data set were endless because there was a good amount of variable types and data itself. Right now the world is very sad so rather than getting a data set that was sad I chose to get something happy. Compared to the other data sets I saw Disney movies was the most interesting. I did not want to do anything with Covid or health because the data did not look interesting and it was sad to look at. Disney movies are a huge part of growing up because the majority of movies you watch are by disney.
